Lash Technician Training App Documentation

Overview

The Lash Technician Training App is an interactive learning platform designed to help aspiring lash artists practice and perfect their lash placement skills. Using advanced drag-and-drop simulation, the app allows users to pinch, drag, and place lashes on a digital model, replicating the precision required in a real-world lash extension application.

The app provides instant feedback on placement accuracy, angle, and spacing, helping users build confidence and refine their technique.

Key Features

Interactive Practice Test
A drag-and-drop interface where users pinch, drag, and place virtual lashes onto the lash line.

Placement Accuracy Assessment
The app measures alignment, spacing, and lash angle, then provides a performance score.

Real-Time Feedback & Tips
Users receive targeted pointers to improve their technique (e.g., spacing too close, angle too sharp, placement off the lash line).

Progress Tracking
Each session is recorded so users can track improvement over time.

Learning Modules (optional add-on)
Educational content on lash safety, lash types, styling, and best practices for professional applications.
